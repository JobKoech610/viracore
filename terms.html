<p>These Terms and conditions set forth the terms and conditions that apply to your access and use of the internet website owned and operated by Viracore including all subsidiary webpages and access to any optimized version of the Site via a wireless device, and access and use of the services available thereon, (the “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you, the person using this Site, and Viracore. Terms such as “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Viracore.</p>
<p>YOU HEREBY ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT. BY DOING ANY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS: (1) VISITING THIS SITE; (2) MAKING A PURCHASE OR SUBMITTING CONTENT THROUGH THE SITE; (3) COMPLETING THE ONLINE APPLICATION PROCESS BY CLICKING A BOX INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE; OR (4) BY EXECUTING A SUBSCRIPTION THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not accept this Agreement and may not use the services.</p>
<p>On our Site, we may provide short summaries of the terms and conditions in this Agreement. Any such summaries are provided only for your convenience, are not legally binding and do not modify this Agreement in any way.</p>
<p>Viracore may update or modify this Agreement or the Privacy Policy at any time and such updated versions will be posted on the Site. You are responsible for periodically checking the Agreement and Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site and/or the Services after this Agreement and/or Privacy Policy are updated shall be deemed acceptance of any such updated Agreement and/or Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Agreement</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use together with such additional terms which specifically apply to some of our services and features as presented on the viracorewebsite(s) all set forth the entire terms and conditions applicable to each visitor or user (“User” our “you”) of the Website and other services, applications and features offered by us with respect thereto, except where we explicitly state otherwise (all services offered through the viracore Website or “Services”).</p>
<p>The Terms constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between viracore.com and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries and you in relation to the use of any our Services – so please read them carefully.</p>
<p>You may visit and/or use the Services only if you fully agree to the Terms – and by using and/or registering to viracoreServices, you signify and affirm your informed consent to these Terms of Use and any other Terms applicable to your use of any viracore Services. If you do not read, fully understand and agree to the Terms, you must immediately leave the Website and avoid or discontinue all use of the Services.</p>
<p>By visiting our website or using services, you are entering into a legal agreement with us, consisting of these Terms of Use, and our additional services’ legal terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>User Account</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>In order to access and use the features of the viracore Services, you must first register and create an account with viracore.</p>
<p>If anyone other than yourself accesses your User Account and/or any of your User Platforms’ settings, they may perform any actions available to you (unless as specifically stated otherwise on the viracoreServices), make changes to your User Platform(s) and User Account, and accept any legal terms available therein, make various representations and warranties and more – and all such activities will be deemed to have occurred on your behalf and in your name.</p>
<p>Therefore, we strongly encourage you to keep the log-in credentials of your User Account confidential, and allow such access only to people you trust – as you will be solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your User Account and/or User Platforms (including for any representations, warranties and undertakings made therein), whether or not specifically authorized by you, and for any damages, expenses or losses that may result from such activities.</p>
<p>You must provide accurate and complete information when registering your User Account and using the viracore Services, to which you are the sole and exclusive rights holder. We strongly encourage you to provide your own (or your company’s) contact and billing details, including your valid e-mail address, as we may use it to identify and determine the actual and true owner of the User Account and/or User Content (as defined below) submitted to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case of a dispute on User Account ownership, we reserve the right to determine ownership to a User Account based on our reasonable judgment, whether or not an independent investigation has been conducted by us. However, if we cannot make such determination (as we may deem in our sole discretion), we reserve the right to avoid doing so and/or suspend a User Account until the parties disputing such ownership, reach a resolution, without liability to you or to any other party. We may request documentation (e.g. government-issued ID, a business license) that may assist us in determining ownership. Among others, we may consider the principles set forth below.</p>
<p>viracorewill consider the owner of a&nbsp;User Account, User Platform and/or User Content&nbsp;created and/or uploaded to the relevant viracoreService, as the person or entity who has access to the e-mail address then listed in viracore’srecords for such User Account under which such User Platform&nbsp;or User Content was created.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the forgoing, we shall have the right to determine the ownership of User Content and/or a User Website as it chooses, including by ignoring the indications set forth above, in event viracoredeems, at its sole discretion, that the situation justifies such determination, all based upon the factual situation as determined by viracore. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To use certain of our services, you need to create a user account.<br><br>You should keep your username and password protected and safe, and only allow people you trust to access your account or website settings.<br><br>All activities that occur under your user account or website are your responsibility.</p>
<p>The account information you provide us must be your own (or your company’s), and be accurate and complete.</p>
<p>When a user account is disputed, we may determine the ownership of such user account.&nbsp;</p>

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, VIRACORE AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, ACCURACY OF DATA, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusion of Liability</strong></p>

<p><strong>Basis of the Bargain; Exclusions</strong></p>
<p>The limitations of liability set out herein are part of the basis of the bargain between you and Viracoreand shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law) even if Viracore or its affiliates has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their essential purpose.</p>
<p>These limitations of liability do not apply to liability for death or personal injury or for fraud, gross negligence or intentional misconduct, or in cases of negligence where a material obligation has been breached, a material obligation being such which forms a prerequisite to our delivery of services and on which you may reasonably rely, but only to the extent that the damages were directly caused by the breach and were foreseeable upon conclusion of this Contract and to the extent that they are typical in the context of this Contract.</p>
<p><strong>Resolving Disputes; Binding Arbitration</strong></p>

If we can’t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may initiate a formal proceeding.</p>
<p>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with viracoreand limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;No Representative Actions. You and viracoreagree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and viracoreand that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;Arbitration of Disputes.&nbsp;Except for small claims disputes in which you or viracoreseeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located where you reside or disputes in which you or viracoreseeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property,&nbsp;you and viracorewaive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “<em>Disputes</em>”) resolved in court. All Disputes submitted will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in __________________, (c) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, viracore, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and viracorewill not have the right to assert the claim.</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp;You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email of your request to&nbsp;_________________________. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.</p>
<p>(f) If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will beenforceable.</p>

All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions including ownership of intellectual property rights, warranty disclaimers, indemnities and limitations of liability.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law</strong></p>
<p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the province of __________________<a></a>Canada, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
<p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.
